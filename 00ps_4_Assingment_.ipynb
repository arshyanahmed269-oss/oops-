        "\n",
        "   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects containing data (attributes) and behavior (methods). It focuses on real-world modeling using concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to make code reusable, modular, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "   - In OOP, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data/variables) and methods (functions/behaviors) that the objects created from it will have.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "   - Dunder methods in Python (short for Double UNDERSCORE methods) are special built-in methods that begin and end with double underscores (__methodname__).\n",
        "   They are also called magic methods and are used to define the behavior of objects for built-in operations.\n",

        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Polymorphism in OOP is the ability of an object to take many forms. It allows different classes to be treated through the same interface, and the same operation can behave differently based on the object calling it.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Enables code flexibility and reusability that is achieved via method overloading, method overriding, and operator overloading.\n",

        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting access to the internal data of a class and providing controlled access through methods.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Key Points:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Hides the internal details of an object to prevent unauthorized access.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Uses access modifiers to define visibility:\n",
        "\n",
        "      a. Public (variable) → Accessible from anywhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "      b. Protected (_variable) → Should not be accessed directly outside the class (convention).\n",
        "\n",
        "      c. Private (__variable) → Not accessible directly from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize an object’s attributes when the object is created.\n",

        "\n",
        "    - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor method, which is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when it is no longer referenced in memory).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Significance of __del__:\n",
        "\n",
        " -  1. Resource Cleanup → Used to release resources like closing files, network connections, or database connections before the object is deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - 2. Finalization → Provides a way to define custom cleanup behavior when an object’s life ends.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "    - **Polymorphism with Inheritance in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "     Polymorphism means **same method name but different behavior** depending on the object calling it.\n",
        "\n",
        "     With **inheritance**, a child class can **override** methods of the parent class, and Python decides at runtime which method to call.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **How it works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - 1. **Parent class defines a method**\n",
        "   - 2. **Child class overrides (redefines) the same method**\n",
        "  - 3. **When called through an object**, Python runs the version depending on the object type (runtime polymorphism).\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",

        "        return \"Bark\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",

        "    print(a.sound())\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Key Idea:**\n",
        "\n",
        " - Even though all objects (`Dog`, `Cat`, `Animal`) call the same method `.sound()`, the **behavior changes depending on the actual object** → that’s polymorphism with inheritance .\n",

        "  -  Without chaining → `calc.add(10); calc.multiply(5); calc.add(2)`\n",
